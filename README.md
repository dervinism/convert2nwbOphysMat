# convert2nwbOphysMat
Matlab functions to convert calcium imaging data and associated intracellular electrophysiology data to Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) file format.

In order to execute the Matlab code, you will also need to download the [matnwb repository](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/matnwb) and add it to your Matlab path.

To get the code with the accompanying example data and test it, download [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki) repository [calcium-imaging-mock-repo](https://gin.g-node.org/dervinism/calcium-imaging-mock-repo).
